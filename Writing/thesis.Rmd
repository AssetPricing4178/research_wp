## Sobol
Sobol's sequence is a quasi-random number sequence widely used in Monte Carlo simulations for its lower discrepancy, leading to faster convergence and stable estimations. Introduced by I.M. Sobol’ as a construction of (t,s)-sequences, the Sobol sequence is a generalized Niederreiter sequence where \(b = 2\), \(P_1(x) = x\), and for \(j = 2, \ldots, s\), \(p_j(x)\) is the \((j - 1)\)-th primitive polynomial in a sequence of all primitive polynomials over \(F_2\) arranged according to nondecreasing degrees (Leobacher 138). The Generalized Niederreiter Sequence is defined as:

\ 

\[ \frac{y_{j;i;k}(x)}{p_j(x^i)} = \sum_{r=1}^{\infty} a^{(j)}(i, k, r) \cdot x^{-r} \]

\

Here,
- \(y_{j;i;k}(x)\) is the Sobol sequence element.
- \(p_j(x)\) is the \(j\)-th primitive polynomial.
- \(a^{(j)}(i, k, r)\) are the coefficients of the corresponding primitive polynomial.

\

The Sobol sequence construction involves using primitive polynomials to generate quasi-random numbers, providing improved distribution properties compared to standard pseudorandom sequences. The equation reveals a relationship between the Sobol sequence element, the primitive polynomial, and the coefficients of the polynomial. Let’s elaborate upon this further by explaining how each component contributes to the Sobol sequence construction:

\

The \(y_{j;i;k}(x)\) component represents a specific element in the Sobol sequence for dimension \(j\), corresponding to the \(i\)-th component and \(k\)-th direction. The \(p_j(x)\) term is responsible for generating Sobol sequences in each dimension. The choice of primitive polynomials is crucial in ensuring effective coverage of the sample space by the Sobol sequence. The \(a^{(j)}(i, k, r)\) term determines the contribution of each term in the series expansion, with specificity to the dimension (\(j\)), component (\(i\)), and direction (\(k\)) of the sequence.

\

As the dimension (\(j\)) increases the series expansion incorporates additional terms, contributing to a more intricate relationship between the Sobol sequence element and the primitive polynomial. This becomes particularly challenging as achieving uniformity and low discrepancy becomes more pronounced in higher dimensions. Sobol sequences are designed to address this challenge, and aim to provide improved distribution properties even as the dimensionality increases. The careful construction involving primitive polynomials allows Sobol sequences to maintain their quasi-random properties across multiple dimensions. 

## Halton

The Classic Halton sequence is a low-discrepancy quasi-random number sequence, widely utilized in various numerical methods, including Monte Carlo simulations and numerical integration. Introduced by J. H. Halton, this sequence is part of the broader class of Halton sequences designed to provide more even coverage of the sample space compared to traditional pseudo-random sequences.

\

The construction of the Classic Halton sequence involves a set of radical-inverse base sequences. A base sequence is a series of values generated using the radical-inverse function with a chosen prime base for each dimension. This process generates a set of values, forming the base sequence for that dimension. For each dimension \(j\), a prime number is chosen as the base, and the sequence is generated by applying the radical-inverse function to the corresponding base. Specifically, the \(i\)-th term in dimension \(j\) of the Halton sequence, denoted as \(H_{j;i}\), is given by:

\

\[ H_{j;i} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_k}{p_j^k} \]

\

where \(d_k\) represents the \(k\)-th digit in the base-\(p_j\) expansion of \(i\).

\

Here,
- \(H_{j;i}\) is the \(i\)-th term in dimension \(j\) of the Classic Halton sequence.
- \(p_j\) is the prime base chosen for dimension \(j\).

\

The Classic Halton sequence is known for its deterministic nature and low-discrepancy properties. Its deterministic construction, in contrast to pseudo-random sequences, allows for reproducibility, essential in various scientific and computational applications.

\

One advantage of the Classic Halton sequence is its suitability for numerical problems involving low to moderate dimensions. As the dimensionality increases, challenges in maintaining quasi-random properties may arise. However, for many applications, particularly in low-dimensional scenarios, the Classic Halton sequence offers improved convergence rates and more uniform distribution of points compared to traditional pseudo-random sequences.

\

In summary, the Classic Halton sequence, rooted in the concept of radical-inverse functions, provides a deterministic and quasi-random approach to generating sequences of points. While its advantages are notable in lower dimensions (Leobacher 47), careful consideration is needed in higher dimensions to maintain its quasi-random properties.

# MC-Integration

Monte Carlo integration is a numerical technique used to estimate definite integrals, especially in high-dimensional spaces, through the utilization of random sampling. Named after the Monte Carlo casino known for chance and randomness, this method leverages random sampling to approximate integrals (Malvin H. Kalos, Monte Carlo Methods, p. 28). Let's look at an example of a Monte Carlo integraion:
